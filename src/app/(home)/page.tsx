        I&apos;m a full-stack software engineer with a focus on cloud
        architecture and a passion for front-end development. I enjoy working
        across the stack — from building UI in React to designing scalable
        systems in AWS. I&apos;m most at home when prototyping, collaborating,
        and diving deep into new ideas. I&apos;m drawn to projects where I can
        contribute to how things are designed — not just how they&apos;re
        implemented.

        As a Senior Principal Developer at RSA, I led I led front-end and cloud
        development across multiple business units, including NetWitness and
        Archer. I helped launch a SaaS risk platform that contributed to
        RSA&apos;s recognition in Gartner&apos;s Magic Quadrant and filed
        several patents around risk modeling and access policy automation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before that, I was a founding engineer at Genify, where I built a
        component-driven front-end architecture that scaled from MVP to
        acquisition. I've contributed to early-stage startups, enterprise
        platforms, and developer tooling — most recently launching WordMuse AI,
        a serverless app that helps users write thoughtful messages using LLMs.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not building, I enjoy hiking and volunteering (most recently
        with Second Harvest). I live in San Jose with two birds — an African
        Grey and a parakeet — who mostly supervise from the sidelines.
